# Semantic search

Prototype building a client based semantic search pipeline

## TODOs

- Add user interface for managing saved data
- Add beta support for dropdown select
- Dont save things that were autofilled manually?
- Dont save same answer, instead update the key with both keys somehow but dont make too long and complicated? OR when retrieving answers remove duplicates
